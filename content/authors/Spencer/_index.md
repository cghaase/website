I have an interest in behavioral, physiological, invasive, and conservation herpetology. Currently I am interested in comparative physiology within the family viperidae. I am also interested in studying invasive reptile impacts and interactions with native species. My thesis research is directed at comparison of energetics between species of viperid snakes.
