My research involves investigating the diverse ways in which organisms interact with their environment. I am generally interested in how environmental constraints such as temperature, energy acquisition, and water balance influence behavior, life-history, and ecology. Most of the work that I do focuses on the ecology and natural history of amphibians and reptiles.
