My primary research interest is the conservation of biodiversity.  I'm particularly interested in how land management practices impact faunal diversity patterns and occupancy of rare species. My thesis focused on understanding the impacts of using controlled burns to restore Oak Savanna habitat on reptile and amphibian community assemblages at Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area in Kentucky.
