My research interests include the ecology, physiology, and conservation of reptiles and amphibians.  I am also interested in the management of both native and invasive species, particularly the impacts that invasive species have on native communities. My thesis research focused on understanding the thermal ecology of copperheads (Agkistrodon contortrix), a widespread North American viperid snake.
