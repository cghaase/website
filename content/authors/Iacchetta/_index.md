My research interests focus on the behavior and ecology of reptiles and amphibians with goal of informing management and conservation decisions for species and their critical habitat. More specifically, I am interested in how natural and anthropogenic habitat alterations effect species survival and fitness. My thesis research focused on the effects of fire-altered habitat on the stress physiology and ecology of the Eastern Fence Lizard (Sceloporus undulatus).
